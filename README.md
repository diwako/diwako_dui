# DUI - Squad Radar for ARMA 3

## A UI showing unit positions and names of units in your squad

## Summary
This mod shows a compass in the bottom middle of your screen and a list of people in your current squad. It is made with SQF commands which recently have been added to Arma3 and were not available back in the days of Arma2 or early Arma3. Meaning no weird workarounds with map elements are needed anymore which just eat more frames.
A strong point of this UI is its customizability and its many features are all settable with CBA settings.

## Special Variables
DUI has a special variable mission makers can use.
### diwako_dui_special_track
Array of objects in `missionNamepace`. Every unit or vehicle in this array will be tracked on compass. Be aware that this might be a performance issue if too many objects are added. Be also aware that you do not add a unit that is already in your squad, or else you have 2 icons for that unit.

# Reporting bugs
Create a fitting title beginning with the tag word "BUG".
In general, be as specific as possible when reporting bugs, it is good to tell how to reproduce it, so it gets fixed faster.

# Requesting Features
For requesting features create a new issue with the tag word "FEATURE" at the beginning of the title. Feature requests can range from new styles to whole new functionality. The feasibility of those requests will be analysed inside the feature request itself

# Pull requests
Tell in detail what your PR will change, why it should be added and what benefits you think it will bring. PRs can be from new styles, bug fixes to whole new functionality. The changes will be reviewed within the PR.
